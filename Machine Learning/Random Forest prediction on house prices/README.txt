This project consist of a RandomForestRegression used to predict prices on properties from a dataset from a kaggle competition.
The python script will read the csv files and train the RandomForestRegression algorithm, then export the results into another CSV file called "prediction.csv".
Also, the script will print 3 plots, the first bar char is used to compare the different possible algorithm and how well they fare with each other.
The other two plots are scatter plots used to show how accurate the prediction was regarding the train-test set.

Further explanations can be found in the PDF explaining everything.
